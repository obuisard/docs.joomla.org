# Tours: Edit

## Description

This screen is used to add a new or edit an existing Tour, usually using a Wysiwyg editor. The default editor is TinyMCE but if other editors are installed the default editor may be set to something else for the site as a whole or for individual users.

A tour must include a least one step. Once a tour has been newly created, go to the tours list and select '0' from the Steps column.

The first step of the tour is automatically made of the tour title and description.

## Quick Tips

- There are 2 methods to insert an image into the tour's description using the TinyMCE editor.
  
  1. The **CMS Content** dropdown list provides access to the **Media** screen that lets you browse image files and upload images.
  
  2. The 'Insert' dropdown list is a simple form for which you need to know the image url. It is used for external images.

- There are 2 ways tours can be created for multilingual environments:
  
  1. Create one tour for each supported language.
  
  2. Create one tour only for all languages and use language keys for title and description.

- Use **GUIDEDTOUR** in language keys as a convention wherever language
   keys are used (for title and description).
